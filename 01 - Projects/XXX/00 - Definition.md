A Multiplayer Video Game That Combines Randomness, Racing, Shooting, and skills

#XXX ©️ is a multiplayer chaotic cross-platform (*Maybe*) game at which players Team up in twos against each other in the sky realm
Host your own server (Like In Minecraft) and compete against your friends on an *UNDEFINED TRACK* that's been built in real time. Try not to fall while beating the incoming environmental hazards
Avoid obstacles and shoot your enemies as they approach from behind. So ... ARE YOU READY? to face your fears and put your skills into action?
Lets see how fine you will be when u face the chaos magic high up in the clouds!
